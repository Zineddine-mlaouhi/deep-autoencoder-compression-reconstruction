This project implements a deep autoencoder using PyTorch to perform unsupervised learning on high-dimensional datasets. The primary objective is to reduce data dimensionality while preserving essential features, enabling efficient storage, visualization, and reconstruction.

Key Components:
- Model Architecture: Multi-layer encoder and decoder network
- Training: On synthetic or real-world datasets (e.g., Gaussian data, MNIST)
- Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Visualization: Comparison of original vs. reconstructed data
- Applications: Anomaly detection, denoising, feature compression
